\begin{abstract} 

User travel patterns are widely studied using social media data like Twitter while not as systematic as using other data sources such as cell phone data and traditional survey data. Specifically, the relationships between people's demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, age and occupation) and their typical temporal and spatial travel patterns(e.g., periodicity of visiting a restaurant, time of leaving home on weekdays) are unclear. Therefore, this project tries to use temporal and spatial travel pattern features combined with Twitter text content features derived from more than 254000 tweets to predict user's gender. The contribution of each feature to the model is weighed to measure its relative importance with the gender label. The test results show that several features are relatively more important, including users' tweet frequency on weekdays, tweet frequency on weekends, tweet frequency in the afternoon, travel distance between home and entertainment space and so on. 

\end{abstract} 


\section{Introduction}

Social media are popular platforms which can record a variety of users' personal information. Among this information, demographic characteristics \cite{sloan2013knowing} and space-time travel patterns \cite{hasan2013understanding} are two of great interesting areas to geographers. Demographic characteristics include gender, age, occupation and so on. Space-time travel patterns refer to the law of people's travel trajectories along both space and time (e.g., periodicity of visiting a restaurant, time of leaving home on weekdays). Traditionally, these two pieces of information are gathered from surveys and interviews \cite{chen2011exploratory}. As the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) develops, they can be mined from cell phone records and other electronic GPS records \cite{sila2016analysis}. However, these methods either cost too much money and too large resources or encroach privacy. Nowadays, social media data could take part in these works with little expense and free of privacy infringement \cite{preoctiuc2013mining}. Researchers have created robust framework and methodologies to mine space-time travel patterns from the geo-tagged online messages with temporal stamps. However, some direct demographic records(e.g., gender and occupation information on Twitter) are missing for some online platforms. It is important to design and implement methods to mine them from online messages \cite{rao2011hierarchical}. 

It is important to restore user demographic information and link them with space-time travel patterns to unveil their relationships \cite{ahn2016gender}. The results indicate social segmentation and contribute to the development of public facilities for different subgroups \cite{ang2010analyzing}. However, few studies are conducted to investigate their relationships. Thus the travel patterns are discussed in terms of a general group of people, which is insufficient for human mobility studies because diverse travel patterns of different subgroups have been studied using other data sources \cite{kang2010analyzing}. To fill the research gap, this paper tries to develop a machine learning classifier to study the characteristic space-time travel pattern features of different subgroups, specifically different genders (male/female/others). Test results of our classifier are compared with an online word-based Bayes network classifier and a first-name-based classifier. Our classifier shows improvement in either test accuracy or in test F1 scores.  

\section{Relate Work}

\subsection{Twitter Gender Inference}
Automatically inferring user gender from Twitter is heavily investigated by both academic socitey and industry because gender is one of the most important demographic property of user.  Generally, there are 3 main approaches used for deriving Twitter users' gender information: (1) profile-based (2) content-based (3) hybrid \cite{beretta2015interactive}.

\subsubsection{Profile-based Gender Inference}

Profile-based methods use the meta-data of users' account in Twitter to help determine the genders of users \cite{sloan2015tweets}. In Twitter, a user can show his name, description, location, followers and friends publicly. Although Twitter does not check the authenticity of profile information, several studies have proven that most Twitter users provide their real name and real gender in their public profile \cite{cesare2017detection}. The simplest and best feature of profile information is users' first name. Previous studies have shown that by comparing name record from nation demographic survey, first name based gender classifier can achieve real good performance \cite{sloan2013knowing, mislove2011understanding} .There are several mature services like genderize.io and packages \footnote{\url{https://github.com/tue-mdse/genderComputer}} \footnote{\url{https://github.com/muatik/genderizer}} inferring gender using only first name. For example \url{genderize.io} provides API that can be used to determine gender of a first name with the help of a database contains 216286 distinct names across 79 countries and 89 languages.  Generally, the profile-based method is considered as the benchmark of gender inference due to the high efficacy it can achieve.  For example, Liu et al. use first name as the main feature to infer gender in Twitter and they obtain the accuracy around 85\% \cite{liu2013s}. 

\subsubsection{Content-based Gender Inference}

Content-based methods focus more on the content posted by Twitter users online. Twitter allows the users to post 140-character tweets(280-character  after Nov.7th, 2017 \footnote{\url{https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/Giving-you-more-characters-to-express-yourself.html}}) on their personal account. Early researches have proven that user of different genders have different word choices and writing styles. For example, Rao et al. tries to processes text generated by Twitter user to extract unigram and bigram features using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to determine latent user attributes like gender information \cite{rao2010classifying}. Several other studies have been using similar n-gram features in combination with logistic and linear regression models to infer more demographic information of the user like gender \cite{burger2011discriminating}, age \cite{nguyen2013old, nguyen2013tweetgenie} ,politic attitudes \cite{pennacchiotti2011democrats}.

In addition to n-grams features, stylistic features in Twitter text have also been used for user gender and other demographic information inference. For instance, several approaches describe methods to determine gender based on the usage of gender specific words like he, she or his, her, abbreviations, punctuation \cite{fink2012inferring}, smileys, repeated letters, pronouns, EMOJI \cite{wolf2000emotional} , hashtags and other grammatical features \cite{cheng2011author,ito2013he}.

However, content based methods require background  and domain specific knowledge of natural language processing and can not be easily extended to other languages. Some studies have made some progresses on this direction but more efforts are needed \cite{mozetivc2016multilingual}.

\subsubsection{Hybrid  Gender Inference}

Hybrid approaches try to combine both profile based methods, content based methods and other source features or information to improve the accuracy of results. Many efforts have been devoted for this methods, for example,  Orlandi et al. tries to use information both from other sources like Facebook and Twitter to infer user profile \cite{orlandi2012aggregated}. Li et al. tries to use online social networks to help user identification in Twitter \cite{li2017solution}. Other directions like using hierarchical knowledge base \cite{kapanipathi2014user},  Twitter account the user following \cite{chamberlain2016probabilistic} or migration patterns \cite{zagheni2014inferring} etc.

In this paper, we want to use the third approach, the hybrid method to infer the user gender information. To be more specific,  we want to combine Twitter users' mobility features like travel pattern with the content based information to design a new system to infer Twitter user gender. Previous studies have already shown that there are differences in Twitter user geo-temporal distribution between different genders \cite{graham2014world,mahmud2014home,weber2014visualizing, longley2016geo}. But few work has been done to utilize the geo-temporal feature of Twitter accounts to infer the gender information.

\subsection{User Temporal and Spatial Travel Patterns}

Human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity \cite{gonzalez2008understanding}. Two important statistical properties of such mobility patterns are displacement length (i.e., distance between a person's positions at consecutive locations) and radius of gyration (i.e., characteristic distance traveled by a person within a specific period of time)\cite{gonzalez2008understanding}. Besides, three kinds of entropy are  calculated to quantify the degree of predictability of a person's travel trajectories \cite{song2010limits}. Respectively, they measure location diversity, heterogeneity of visitation patterns along time and the full  temporal and spatial order of the person's mobility pattern. Moreover, the number of co-location records  are summarized within different time period to measure the size of the set of co-locations in social network studies \cite{cranshaw2010bridging}. 

Although different variables characterizing detailed temporal and spatial travel patterns have been proposed , they are based on dense cell phone record data or verbose survey data. For the rising social media data,  temporal and spatial  travel patterns are usually visualized for interactive investigations \cite{yin2016exploring}, while lacking numeric parameters for further statistical analysis. Different from previous dense data study, social media data like Twitter is sparse, which only captures noncontinuous segments of users' travel trajectories. So it  is hard to get enough useful features from Twitter data. To use the travel patterns stored in social media data like Twitter, our project tries to design new temporal and spatial features to represent travel patterns and weigh their relative importance to the classifier through several tests.

%\subsection{Submitting Papers}
%
%{\bf Paper Deadline:} The deadline for paper submission to ICML 2017
%is at \textbf{23:59 Universal Time (3:59 p.m.\ Pacific Standard Time) on February 24, 2017}.
%If your full submission does not reach us by this time, it will 
%not be considered for publication. There is no separate abstract submission.
%
%{\bf Anonymous Submission:} To facilitate blind review, no identifying
%author information should appear on the title page or in the paper
%itself.  Section~\ref{author info} will explain the details of how to
%format this.
%
%{\bf Simultaneous Submission:} ICML will not accept any paper which,
%at the time of submission, is under review for another conference or
%has already been published. This policy also applies to papers that
%overlap substantially in technical content with conference papers
%under review or previously published. ICML submissions must not be
%submitted to other conferences during ICML's review period. Authors
%may submit to ICML substantially different versions of journal papers
%that are currently under review by the journal, but not yet accepted
%at the time of submission. Informal publications, such as technical
%reports or papers in workshop proceedings which do not appear in
%print, do not fall under these restrictions.
%
%\medskip
%
%To ensure our ability to print submissions, authors must provide their
%manuscripts in \textbf{PDF} format.  Furthermore, please make sure
%that files contain only Type-1 fonts (e.g.,~using the program {\tt
%  pdffonts} in linux or using File/DocumentProperties/Fonts in
%Acrobat).  Other fonts (like Type-3) might come from graphics files
%imported into the document.
%
%Authors using \textbf{Word} must convert their document to PDF.  Most
%of the latest versions of Word have the facility to do this
%automatically.  Submissions will not be accepted in Word format or any
%format other than PDF. Really. We're not joking. Don't send Word.
%
%Those who use \textbf{\LaTeX} to format their accepted papers need to pay close
%attention to the typefaces used.  Specifically, when producing the PDF by first
%converting the dvi output of \LaTeX\ to Postscript the default behavior is to
%use non-scalable Type-3 PostScript bitmap fonts to represent the standard
%\LaTeX\ fonts. The resulting document is difficult to read in electronic form;
%the type appears fuzzy. To avoid this problem, dvips must be instructed to use
%an alternative font map.  This can be achieved with the following two commands:
%
%{\footnotesize
%\begin{verbatim}
%dvips -Ppdf -tletter -G0 -o paper.ps paper.dvi
%ps2pdf paper.ps
%\end{verbatim}}
%Note that it is a zero following the ``-G''.  This tells dvips to use
%the config.pdf file (and this file refers to a better font mapping).
%
%A better alternative is to use the \textbf{pdflatex} program instead of
%straight \LaTeX. This program avoids the Type-3 font problem, however you must
%ensure that all of the fonts are embedded (use {\tt pdffonts}). If they are
%not, you need to configure pdflatex to use a font map file that specifies that
%the fonts be embedded. Also you should ensure that images are not downsampled
%or otherwise compressed in a lossy way.
%
%Note that the 2017 style files use the {\tt hyperref} package to
%make clickable links in documents.  If this causes problems for you,
%add {\tt nohyperref} as one of the options to the {\tt icml2017}
%usepackage statement.
%
%\subsection{Reacting to Reviews}
%
%We will continue the ICML tradition in which the authors are given the
%option of providing a short reaction to the initial reviews. These
%reactions will be taken into account in the discussion among the
%reviewers and area chairs.
%
%\subsection{Submitting Final Camera-Ready Copy}
%
%The final versions of papers accepted for publication should follow the
%same format and naming convention as initial submissions, except of
%course that the normal author information (names and affiliations)
%should be given.  See Section~\ref{final author} for details of how to
%format this.
%
%The footnote, ``Preliminary work.  Under review by the International
%Conference on Machine Learning (ICML).  Do not distribute.'' must be
%modified to ``\textit{Proceedings of the
%$\mathit{34}^{th}$ International Conference on Machine Learning},
%Sydney, Australia, PMLR 70, 2017.
%Copyright 2017 by the author(s).'' 
%
%For those using the \textbf{\LaTeX} style file, this change (and others) is
%handled automatically by simply changing
%$\mathtt{\backslash usepackage\{icml2017\}}$ to 
%$$\mathtt{\backslash usepackage[accepted]\{icml2017\}}$$
%Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the
%footnote on the first page of the document themselves.
%
%Camera-ready copies should have the title of the paper as running head
%on each page except the first one.  The running title consists of a
%single line centered above a horizontal rule which is $1$ point thick.
%The running head should be centered, bold and in $9$ point type.  The
%rule should be $10$ points above the main text.  For those using the
%\textbf{\LaTeX} style file, the original title is automatically set as running
%head using the {\tt fancyhdr} package which is included in the ICML
%2017 style file package.  In case that the original title exceeds the
%size restrictions, a shorter form can be supplied by using
%
%\verb|\icmltitlerunning{...}|
%
%just before $\mathtt{\backslash begin\{document\}}$.
%Authors using \textbf{Word} must edit the header of the document themselves.
%
%\section{Format of the Paper} 
% 
%All submissions must follow the same format to ensure the printer can
%reproduce them without problems and to let readers more easily find
%the information that they desire.
%
%\subsection{Length and Dimensions}
%
%Papers must not exceed eight (8) pages, including all figures, tables,
%and appendices, but excluding references and acknowledgements. When references and acknowledgements are included,
%the paper must not exceed ten (10) pages.
%Acknowledgements should be limited to grants and people who contributed to the paper.
%Any submission that exceeds 
%this page limit or that diverges significantly from the format specified 
%herein will be rejected without review.
%
%The text of the paper should be formatted in two columns, with an
%overall width of 6.75 inches, height of 9.0 inches, and 0.25 inches
%between the columns. The left margin should be 0.75 inches and the top
%margin 1.0 inch (2.54~cm). The right and bottom margins will depend on
%whether you print on US letter or A4 paper, but all final versions
%must be produced for US letter size.
%
%The paper body should be set in 10~point type with a vertical spacing
%of 11~points. Please use Times typeface throughout the text.
%
%\subsection{Title}
%
%The paper title should be set in 14~point bold type and centered
%between two horizontal rules that are 1~point thick, with 1.0~inch
%between the top rule and the top edge of the page. Capitalize the
%first letter of content words and put the rest of the title in lower
%case.
%
%\subsection{Author Information for Submission}
%\label{author info}
%
%To facilitate blind review, author information must not appear.  If
%you are using \LaTeX\/ and the \texttt{icml2017.sty} file, you may use
%\verb+\icmlauthor{...}+ to specify authors and \verb+\icmlaffiliation{...}+ to specify affiliations. (Read the TeX code used to produce this document for an example usage.)  The author information
%will  not be printed unless {\tt accepted} is passed as an argument to the
%style file. (Again, see the TeX code used to produce this PDF.) 
%Submissions that include the author information will not
%be reviewed.
%
%\subsubsection{Self-Citations}
%
%If your are citing published papers for which you are an author, refer
%to yourself in the third person. In particular, do not use phrases
%that reveal your identity (e.g., ``in previous work \cite{langley00}, we 
%have shown \ldots'').
%
%Do not anonymize citations in the reference section by removing or
%blacking out author names. The only exception are manuscripts that are
%not yet published (e.g. under submission). If you choose to refer to
%such unpublished manuscripts \cite{anonymous}, anonymized copies have 
%to be submitted
%as Supplementary Material via CMT. However, keep in mind that an ICML
%paper should be self contained and should contain sufficient detail
%for the reviewers to evaluate the work. In particular, reviewers are
%not required to look a the Supplementary Material when writing their
%review.
%
%\subsubsection{Camera-Ready Author Information}
%\label{final author}
%
%If a paper is accepted, a final camera-ready copy must be prepared.
%%
%For camera-ready papers, author information should start 0.3~inches
%below the bottom rule surrounding the title. The authors' names should
%appear in 10~point bold type, in a row, separated by white space, and centered. 
%Author names should not be broken across lines.
%Unbolded superscripted numbers, starting 1, should be used to refer to affiliations. 
%Affiliations should be numbered in the order of appearance.  A single footnote block of text should be used to list all the affiliations. (Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, State/Region, Country. Similarly for industrial affiliations.)
%Each distinct affiliations should be listed once.  If an author has multiple affiliations, multiple superscripts should be placed after the name, separated by thin spaces.  If the authors would like to highlight equal contribution by multiple first authors, those authors should have an asterisk placed after their name in superscript, and the term ``\textsuperscript{*}Equal contribution" should be placed in the footnote block ahead of the list of affiliations.  A list of corresponding authors and their emails (in the format Full Name \textless{}email@domain.com\textgreater{}) can follow the list of affiliations. Ideally only one or two names should be listed.
%
%
%A sample file (in PDF) with author names is included in the ICML2017 
%style file package.  Turn on the \texttt{[accepted]} option to the ICML stylefile to see the names rendered. 
%All of the guidelines above are automatically met by the \LaTeX\ style file.
%
%\subsection{Abstract}
%
%The paper abstract should begin in the left column, 0.4~inches below
%the final address. The heading `Abstract' should be centered, bold,
%and in 11~point type. The abstract body should use 10~point type, with
%a vertical spacing of 11~points, and should be indented 0.25~inches
%more than normal on left-hand and right-hand margins. Insert
%0.4~inches of blank space after the body. Keep your abstract brief and 
%self-contained,
%limiting it to one paragraph and roughly 4--6 sentences.  Gross violations will require correction at the camera-ready phase.
%
%\subsection{Partitioning the Text} 
%
%You should organize your paper into sections and paragraphs to help
%readers place a structure on the material and understand its
%contributions.
%
%\subsubsection{Sections and Subsections}
%
%Section headings should be numbered, flush left, and set in 11~pt bold
%type with the content words capitalized. Leave 0.25~inches of space
%before the heading and 0.15~inches after the heading.
%
%Similarly, subsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and set
%in 10~pt bold type with the content words capitalized. Leave
%0.2~inches of space before the heading and 0.13~inches afterward.
%
%Finally, subsubsection headings should be numbered, flush left, and
%set in 10~pt small caps with the content words capitalized. Leave
%0.18~inches of space before the heading and 0.1~inches after the
%heading. 
%
%Please use no more than three levels of headings.
%
%\subsubsection{Paragraphs and Footnotes}
%
%Within each section or subsection, you should further partition the
%paper into paragraphs. Do not indent the first line of a given
%paragraph, but insert a blank line between succeeding ones.
% 
%You can use footnotes\footnote{For the sake of readability, footnotes
%should be complete sentences.} to provide readers with additional
%information about a topic without interrupting the flow of the paper. 
%Indicate footnotes with a number in the text where the point is most
%relevant. Place the footnote in 9~point type at the bottom of the
%column in which it appears. Precede the first footnote in a column
%with a horizontal rule of 0.8~inches.\footnote{Multiple footnotes can
%appear in each column, in the same order as they appear in the text,
%but spread them across columns and pages if possible.}

%
%Label all distinct components of each figure. If the figure takes the

%\subsection{Tables} 
% 
%You may also want to include tables that summarize material. Like 
%figures, these should be centered, legible, and numbered consecutively. 
%However, place the title {\it above\/} the table with at least 
%0.1~inches of space before the title and the same after it, as in 
%Table~\ref{sample-table}. The table title should be set in 9~point 
%type and centered unless it runs two or more lines, in which case it
%should be flush left.
%
%% Note use of \abovespace and \belowspace to get reasonable spacing 
%% above and below tabular lines.

%
%Tables contain textual material that can be typeset, as contrasted 
%with figures, which contain graphical material that must be drawn. 
%Specify the contents of each row and column in the table's topmost
%row. Again, you may float tables to a column's top or bottom, and set
%wide tables across both columns, but place two-column tables at the
%top or bottom of the page.
% 
%\subsection{Citations and References} 
%
%Please use APA reference format regardless of your formatter
%or word processor. If you rely on the \LaTeX\/ bibliographic 
%facility, use {\tt natbib.sty} and {\tt icml2017.bst} 
%included in the style-file package to obtain this format.
%
%Citations within the text should include the authors' last names and
%year. If the authors' names are included in the sentence, place only
%the year in parentheses, for example when referencing Arthur Samuel's
%pioneering work \yrcite{Samuel59}. Otherwise place the entire
%reference in parentheses with the authors and year separated by a
%comma \cite{Samuel59}. List multiple references separated by
%semicolons \cite{kearns89,Samuel59,mitchell80}. Use the `et~al.'
%construct only for citations with three or more authors or after
%listing all authors to a publication in an earlier reference \cite{MachineLearningI}.
%
%Authors should cite their own work in the third person
%in the initial version of their paper submitted for blind review.
%Please refer to Section~\ref{author info} for detailed instructions on how to
%cite your own papers.
%
%Use an unnumbered first-level section heading for the references, and 
%use a hanging indent style, with the first line of the reference flush
%against the left margin and subsequent lines indented by 10 points. 
%The references at the end of this document give examples for journal
%articles \cite{Samuel59}, conference publications \cite{langley00}, book chapters \cite{Newell81}, books \cite{DudaHart2nd}, edited volumes \cite{MachineLearningI}, 
%technical reports \cite{mitchell80}, and dissertations \cite{kearns89}. 
%
%Alphabetize references by the surnames of the first authors, with
%single author entries preceding multiple author entries. Order
%references for the same authors by year of publication, with the
%earliest first. Make sure that each reference includes all relevant
%information (e.g., page numbers).



% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
